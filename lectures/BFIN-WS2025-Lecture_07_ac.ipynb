    "    *   This is a classic case of omitted-variable bias: what appeared to be alpha in the CAPM was actually compensation for bearing Size or Value risk, which can be replicated cheaply with passive ETFs.\n",

    "*   **N-CAPM and the Neutrality Trap:**\n",

    "    *   **Structural Alpha:** Under N-CAPM, the measured alpha is the sum of exposures to these omitted, priced N-images: $\\alpha_i^{CAPM} \\equiv - \\sum_{k=1}^{K} n_{i}^{(k)} \\lambda_{N,k}$.\n",
    "    *   **Neutrality Trap:** A portfolio may be statistically uncorrelated with the market ($\\text{Cov}(R_P, R_M) = 0$) yet economically correlated because its **Risk Premium** co-moves with the market's risk premium (both driven by aggregate wealth).
